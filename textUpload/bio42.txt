[P]->We evaluated the hydrodynamic performance of kangaroo aortic valve matrices (KMs) (19, 21, and 23 mm), as potential scaffolds in tissue valve engineering using a pulsatile left heart model at low and high cardiac outputs (COs) and heart rates (HRs) of 60 and 90 beats/min . [M]->Data were measured in two samples of each type, pooled in two CO levels (2.1 +/- 0.7 and 4.2 +/- 0.6 L/min; mean +/- standard errors on the mean), and analyzed using analysis of variance with CO level, HR, and valve type as fixed factors and compared to similar porcine matrices (PMs) . [R]->Transvalvular pressure gradient (DeltaP) was a function of HR (P < 0.001) and CO (P < 0.001) but not of valve type (P = 0.39) . [R]->DeltaP was consistently lower in KMs but not significantly different from PMs . [R]->The effective orifice area and performance index of kangaroo matrices was statistically larger for all sizes at both COs and HRs .
