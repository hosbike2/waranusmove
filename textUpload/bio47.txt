[B]->An artificial sphincter prototype has been developed, specifically designed for comfortable remote control by fecally incontinent patients . [B]->The artificial sphincter includes a fluid reservoir, an occlusive cuff, and a micropump based on piezo-technology in a single unit . [M]->Continence and implantation management were evaluated around isolated porcine anal canals and in vivo . [R]->The design of the prosthesis reduces the occlusion pressure and allows low inflation volumes (6.5-16 mL) . [R]->Operating pressures between 24 and 58 mm Hg indicate a minor risk of ischemic injury to the bowel . [R]->The operation time is estimated at about 7 days with no recharging of the battery . [D]->The novel prototype is a highly integrated prosthesis for placement around the anal canal or lower rectum, effecting continence with comfortable control .
