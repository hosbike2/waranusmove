[B]->The four-dimensional (4-D) NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom, which provides a realisticmodel of the normal human anatomy and cardiac and respiratory motions, is used in medical imagingresearch to evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques, especially dynamic cardiac applications . [B]->One limitation of the phantom is that it lacks the ability to accurately simulate altered functions of the heart that result from cardiac pathologies such as coronary artery disease (CAD) . [P]->The goal of this work was to enhance the 4-D NCAT phantom by incorporating a physiologically based,finite-element (FE) mechanical model of the left ventricle (LV) to simulate both normal and abnormal cardiac motions . [M]->The geometry of the FE mechanical model was based on gated high-resolution X-ray multislice computed tomography (MSCT) data of a healthy male subject . [M]->The myocardial wall was represented as a transversely isotropic hyperelastic material, with the fiber angle varying from -90deg at the epicardial surface, through 0deg at the midwall, to 90deg at the endocardial surface . [M]->A time-varying elastance model was used to simulate fiber contraction, and physiological intraventricular systolic pressure-time curves were applied to simulate the cardiac motion over the entire cardiac cycle . [M]->To demonstrate the ability of the FE mechanical model to accurately simulate the normal cardiac motion as well as the abnormal motions indicative of CAD, a normal case and two pathologic cases were simulated and analyzed . [M]->In the first pathologic model, a subendocardial anterior ischemic region was defined . [M]->A second model was created with a transmural ischemic region defined in the same location . [R]->The FE-based deformations were incorporated into the 4-D NCAT cardiac model through the control points that define the cardiac structures in the phantom which were set to move according to the predictions of the mechanical model . [R]->A simulation study was performed using the FE-NCATcombination to investigate how the differences in contractile function between the subendocardial and transmural infarcts manifest themselves in myocardial Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images . [R]->The normal FE model produced strain distributions that were consistent with those reported in the literature and a motion consistent with that defined in the normal 4-D NCAT beating heart model based on tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data . [R]->The addition of a subendocardial ischemic region changed the average transmural circumferential strain from a contractile value of -0.09 to a tensile value of 0.02 . [R]->The addition of a transmural ischemic region changed average circumferential strain to a value of 0.13, which is consistent with data reported in the literature . [R]->Model results demonstrated differences in contractile function between subendocardial and transmural infarcts and how these differences in function are documented in simulated myocardial SPECT images produced using the 4-D NCAT phantom . [R]->Compared with the original NCAT beating heart model, the FE mechanical model produced a more accurate simulation for the cardiac motion abnormalities . [D]->Such a model, when incorporated into the 4-D NCAT phantom, has great potential for use in cardiac imagingresearch . [D]->With its enhanced physiologically based cardiac model, the 4-D NCAT phantom can be used to simulate realistic, predictive imaging data of a patient population with varying whole-body anatomy and with varying healthy and diseased states of the heart that will provide a known truth from which to evaluate and improve existing and emerging 4-D imaging techniques used in the diagnosis of cardiac disease .
