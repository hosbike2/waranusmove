[M]->A multimodal treatment protocol with immunoadsorption (IA) as the central element was used in the treatment of my asthenic crisis (MC) . [M]->Fifteen patients with MC were treated in repeated, uninterrupted 7-day cycles until mobilization with: (i) large-volume IA using an antihuman-IgG adsorber, days 1-5; (ii) intravenous immunoglobulin substitution (0.3-0.5 g/kg body weight [BW]/day), days 5-7; and (iii) immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (1-2 mg/kg BW/day) and prednisolone (0.5-1 mg/kg BW/day), until remission . [M]->Patients required a median of 8 days of mechanical ventilation, 12 days in the intensive care unit, and 35 days of hospitalization . [R]->Functional improvement compared to their precrisis condition was attained by 14 of 15 patients . [R]->MG severity score improved by a mean of 10 points, quality of life score by 9.8 points, and Karnofsky index by 29 points in 14 of 15 patients . [R]->Improvements remained stable and no further crises occurred during long-term follow-up, which averaged 4.4 years . [R]->No fatalities due to MC occurred . [D]->The results demonstrate that our protocol is a potent therapeutic approach in the treatment of MC .
