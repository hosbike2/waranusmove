[B]->Calcium phosphate bioceramics, such as hydroxyapatite, have long been used as bone substitutes because of their proven biocompatibility and bone binding properties in vivo . [B]->Recently, a zirconia-hybridized pyrophosphate-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (Zr-ACP) has been synthesized, which is more soluble than hydroxyapatite and allows for controlled release of calcium and phosphate ions . [B]->These ions have been postulated to increase osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro . [P]->The focus of this work is to elucidate the physicochemical properties of Zr-ACP and to measure cell response to Zr-ACP in vitro using a MC3T3-E1 mouse calvarial-derived osteoprogenitor cell line . [M]->Cells were cultured in osteogenic medium and mineral was added to culture at different stages in cell maturation . [R]->Culture in the presence of Zr-ACP showed significant increases in cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), and osteopontin (OPN) synthesis, whereas collagen synthesis was unaffected . [R]->In addition, calcium and phosphate ion concentrations and medium pH were found to transiently increase with the addition of Zr-ACP, and are hypothesized to be responsible for the osteogenic effect of Zr-ACP .
