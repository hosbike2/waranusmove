[B]->Increased physical activity is important for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease . [B]->However, among people with disabilities, inactivity is prevalent . [M]->In order to encourage exercise among members of this group, an exercise system combining arm ergometry with video gaming, called theGAME(Cycle) was previously developed . [M]->User input was received through an arm crank ergometer on a swivel, with the angular velocity of the ergometer resistance wheel controlling one axis and rotation of ergometer about the swivel controlling the other . [P]->The purpose of this study was to detail the algorithms used in this device and present novel features included in a second generation of the GAME(Cycle) . [M]->The features include a wheel on base, a steering return mechanism, and wireless fire buttons . [M]->A focus group of clinicians (n = 8), wheelchair users (n = 8), and clinician wheelchair users (n = 2) was conducted to evaluate the features of the GAME(Cycle) . [R]->The focus group suggested improvements to the steering mechanism and to reduce vibration in the system . [R]->However, the focus group enjoyed the GAME(Cycle) and felt that it would encourage exercise among persons with disabilities .
