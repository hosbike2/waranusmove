[B]->Elasticity imaging is a burgeoning medical imaging field . [B]->Many methods have been proposed that impart a force to tissue and measure the mechanical response . [B]->One method, vibro-acoustography, uses the ultrasound radiation force to harmonically vibrate tissue and measure the resulting acoustic emission field with a nearby hydrophone . [B]->Another method, vibrometry, uses the ultrasound radiation force accompanied with a measurement of the resulting velocity or displacement of the vibrating tissue or object has also been used for different applications . [M]->An extension of the vibro-acoustography method using a multifrequency stress field to vibrate an object is described . [P]->The objective of this paper is to present the image formation theory for multifrequency vibro-acoustography . [R]->We show that the number of low-frequency components created by this multifrequency method scales with the square of the number of ultrasound sources used . [R]->We provide experimental validation of the point-spread function of the multifrequency stress field and show examples of both vibrometry and vibro-acoustography imaging applications . [D]->This method holds the potential for a large gain of information with no increase in scanning time compared to conventional vibro-acoustography systems .
