[P]->This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of a trabecular bone substitute can be enhanced through in vitro tissueformation . [P]->Our specific objectives were to (1) determine the effects of in vitro marrow stromal cell-mediated tissue deposition upon a trabeculatedhydroxyapatite scaffold on the strength and toughness of the resulting bone substitute; and (2) identify and characterize regions of newly deposited matrix and mineral . [D]->This work provides a basis for future investigations aimed at transforming a brittle hydroxyapatite scaffold into an osteoinductive, biomechanically functional implant through in vitro bone deposition . [R]->As hypothesized, the mechanical properties of the trabecular bone substitutes were significantly enhanced by in vitro tissue formation . [R]->As a result of cell seeding and a 5 week culture protocol, mean strength increased by 85% (p = 0.008) and energy to fracture increased by 130% (p = 0.003) . [R]->Accompanying the enhancement of mechanical properties was the deposition of significant amounts of bone matrix and mineral . [R]->Fluorescence imaging, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and nanoindentation confirmed the presence of bonelike mineral with Ca/P ratio, modulus, and hardness similar to that within human and rat trabecularbone tissue . [R]->This new mineralization was found to exist within a newly deposited parallel-fibered matrix both encasing and bridging between scaffold trabeculae . [D]->Taken as a whole, our results establish the feasibility of the production of an osteoinductive hydroxyapatite-based trabecular bonesubstitute with mechanical properties enhanced through in vitro bone deposition .
