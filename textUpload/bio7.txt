[B]->Cupping and streak artifacts caused by the detection of scattered photons may severely degrade the quantitative accuracy of cone-beam X-ray computed tomography (CT) images . [P]->In order to overcome this problem, we propose and validate the following iterative scatter artifact reduction scheme . [M]->First, an initial image is reconstructed from the scatter-contaminated projections . [M]->Next, the scatter component of the projections is estimated from the initial reconstruction by a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation . [M]->The estimate obtained is then utilized during the reconstruction of a scatter-corrected image . [M]->The last two steps are repeated until an adequate correction is obtained . [M]->The estimation of the noise-free scatterprojections in this scheme is accelerated in the following way: first, a rapid (i.e., based on a low number of simulated photon tracks) MC simulation is executed . [M]->The noisy result of this simulation is de-noised by a three-dimensional fitting of Gaussian basis functions . [R]->We demonstrate that, compared to plain MC, this method shortens the required simulation time by three to four orders of magnitude . [R]->Using simulated projections of a small animal phantom, we show that one cycle of the scatter correction scheme is sufficient to produce reconstructed images that barely differ from the reconstructions of scatter-free projections . [R]->The reconstructions of data acquired with a charge-coupled device based micro-CTscanner demonstrate a nearly complete removal of the scatter-induced cupping artifact . [R]->Quantitative errors in a water phantom are reduced from around 12% for reconstructions without the scattercorrection to 1% after the proposed scatter correction has been applied . [D]->In conclusion, a general, accurate, and efficient scatter correction algorithm is developed that requires no mechanical modifications of the scanning equipment and results in only a moderate increase in the total reconstruction time .
