[P]->This study was designed to determine whether the novel spatial geometry of macroporous condensed poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (cPTFE) favorably affects the in vivo repair process . [P]->Specifically, the macroporous surface geometry and the reduced material thickness contribute to better healing characteristics . [M]->For this purpose, three other materials used for abdominal wall repair were selected, expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE), low-weight poly(propylene) (lwPP), and high-weight poly(propylene) (hwPP) . [M]->Samples of each material (1 x 2 cm, n = 4) were implanted subcutaneously in rats for 7, 28, or 56 days . [R]->After sacrificing the animals, at each time point, the tissue implant sites were subjected to morphometric analysis and evaluation of inflammatory and wound-healing tissue characteristics . [R]->Although the fibrous capsule thickness did not significantly vary among the four materials (p > 0.05), cPTFE consistently led to the most mature fibrous capsule . [R]->However, ePTFE showed the greatest tissue-material integration . [R]->Both PP materials presented various levels of tissue integration, but they were characterized by significant early inflammation and increased foreign body reaction around the mesh openings, especially for hwPP . [R]->In contrast, cPTFE did not induce extensive inflammation or elevated foreign body reaction around its mesh openings . [D]->We conclude that cPTFE combines the inherent PTFE biocompatibility with low polymer surface area (large mesh openings, reduced material thickness) leading to a better inflammatory and wound healing response compared to available materials used in abdominal wall reconstruction .
