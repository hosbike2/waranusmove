[B]->Three-dimensional (3-D) recording of the surface of the human body or anatomical areas has gained importance in many medical specialties . [B]->Thus, it is important to determine scanner precision andaccuracy in defined medical applications and to establish standards for the recording procedure . [P]->Here we evaluated the precision and accuracy of 3-D assessment of the facial area with the Minolta Vivid 910 3D Laser Scanner . [M]->We also investigated the influence of factors related to the recording procedure and the processing of scanner data on final results . [M]->These factors include lighting, alignment of scanner and object, the examiner, and the software used to convert measurements into virtual images. [M]->To assess scanner accuracy, we compared scanner data to those obtained by manual measurements on a dummy . [R]->Less than 7% of all results with the scanner method were outside a range of error of 2 mm when compared to corresponding reference measurements . [R]->Accuracy, thus, proved to be good enough to satisfy requirements for numerous clinical applications . [R]->Moreover, the experiments completed with the dummy yielded valuable information for optimizing recording parameters for best results . [R]->Thus, under defined conditions, precision and accuracy of surface models of the human face recorded with the Minolta Vivid 910 3D Scanner presumably can also be enhanced . [D]->Future studies will involve verification of our findings using test persons . [D]->The current findings indicate that the Minolta Vivid 910 3D Scanner might be used with benefit in medicine when recording the 3-D surface structures of the face .
