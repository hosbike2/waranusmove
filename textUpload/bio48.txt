[P]->The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our novel Innsbruck Bioartificial Liver (IBAL; US patent no 10/641275), which contains aggregates of porcine hepatocytes grown under simulated microgravity, in a porcine model of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) . [M]->FHF was induced by a combination of 75-80% liver resection and ischemia of the remnant segments for 60 min in 12 pigs . [M]->Two experimental groups were studied: the control group (n = 5) received standard intensive care and the study group (n = 5) received IBAL treatment . [R]->The survival of pigs with FHF was significantly prolonged by about 150% with IBAL treatment as compared to controls (controls: 20.4 +/- 2.8 h, IBAL: 51.0 +/- 2.2 h; P = 0.00184) . [R]->In addition, intracranial pressure, blood ammonia, lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels were lower in the IBAL group than in controls, indicating metabolic activity of porcine hepatocytes in the bioreactor . [R]->No adverse effects were observed .
