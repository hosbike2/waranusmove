[B]->The effects of spinal cord injuries are likely to be ameliorated with the help of functional electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, a technique that may benefit from a new style of electrode: the cylindrical multielectrode . [P]->This paper describes the specifications for, fabrication techniques for, and in vitro evaluation of cylindrical multielectrodes . [M]->Four tip shapes were tested to determine which shape required the lowest peak force and would, therefore, be expected to minimize dimpling during implantation . [M]->The impedance of the electrode interface was monitored for changes due to insertion as well as repetitive delivery of current pulses . [R]->The charge delivery capacity was determined by testing with safe (< or = 0.6 mC/cm2) and damaging levels (> or = 0.8 mC/cm2) of charge density . [D]->The results of these tests suggest that this electrode design could be used to stimulate neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord .
