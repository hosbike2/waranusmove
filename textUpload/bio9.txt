[B]->Screening programs using retinal photography for the detection of diabetic eye disease are being introduced in the U.K. and elsewhere . [B]->Automatic grading of the images is being considered by health boards so that the human grading task is reduced . [B]->Microaneurysms (MAs) are the earliest sign of this disease and so are very important for classifying whether images show signs of retinopathy . [P]->This paper describes automatic methods for MA detection and shows how image contrast normalization can improve the ability to distinguish between MAs and other dots that occur on the retina . [M]->Various methods for contrast normalization are compared . [M]->Best results were obtained with a method that uses the watershed transform to derive a region that contains no vessels or other lesions . [M]->Dots within vesselsare handled successfully using a local vessel detection technique . [R]->Results are presented for detectionof individual MAs and for detection of images containing MAs . [R]->Images containing MAs are detected with sensitivity 85.4% and specificity 83.1% .
