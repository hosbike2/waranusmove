[B]->Heartbeats are a point process yet, most of the current analysis methods do not model this important characteristic of these data . [P]->We describe human heartbeat time series as a history dependent inverse Gaussian model . [M]->We present a point process adaptive filter algorithm to estimate the model's time-varying parameters, and use it to compute new measures of heart rate variability . [M]->We apply our algorithm to analyze simulated heartbeatdata and actual heartbeat data from a tilt table experiment and from healthy subjects and subjects with congestive heart failure during sleep . [D]->Our results suggest a new approach for characterizing heartbeat dynamics .
