[B]->Albumin dialysis by the molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) and by fractionated plasma separation, adsorption, and dialysis (Prometheus[PROM]) represent novel nonbiological liver support systems specifically designed to remove albumin-bound substances . [B]->Preliminary evidence suggests a favorable impact of MARS on the course and outcome of liver failure . [P]->This study aimed at comparing the detoxification capacity of both devices . [M]->For this purpose, we performed a retrospective analysis on data prospectively collected in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure treated with either the MARS (n = 9) or the PROM (n = 9) device on 2-5 consecutive days . [M]->Each treatment was performed for at least 5 h at identical blood and dialysate flows . [M]->Blood clearances were calculated during the first treatment session for urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, and bile acids from paired arterial and venous line samples after 1, 4, and 6 h of treatment . [M]->Reduction ratios for all single-treatment sessions, and the overall treatment phase, were calculated from pretreatment and post-treatment values. [R]->For all markers but bile acids, the single-treatment as well as the overall treatment phase reduction ratios obtained with PROM were significantly higher compared with those obtained with MARS . [R]->PROM led at all time points to higher clearances for all evaluated solutes . [R]->Blood clearances of protein-bound substances declined over time with MARS, but not with PROM . [D]->In conclusion, a significant decline in the serum level of water-soluble and protein-bound toxins was achieved with both devices . [D]->PROM produces higher blood clearances for most toxins, which results in higher delivered treatment doses compared with a matching treatment with MARS .
