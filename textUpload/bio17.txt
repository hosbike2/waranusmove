[B]->Acrylic bone cement, based on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), is a proven polymer having important applications in medicine and dentistry, but this polymer continues to have less than ideal resistance to mechanical fatigue and impact . [B]->A variety of materials have been added to bone cement to augment its mechanical strength, but none of these augmentative materials has proven successful . [B]->Carbon nanotubes, a new hollow multiwalled tubular material 10-40 nm in diameter, 10-100 microm long, and 50-100 times the strength of steel at 1/6 the weight, have emerged as a viableaugmentation candidate because of their large surface area to volume ratio . [P]->The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of multiwallcarbon nanotubes to bone cement can alter its static or dynamic mechanical properties . [M]->Bar-shaped specimens made from six different (0-10% by weight) concentrations of multiwall carbon nanotubes were tested to failure in quasi-static 3-point bending and in 4-point bending fatigue (5 Hz) . [M]->Analyses of variance and the 3-Parameter Weibull model were used to analyze the material performance data . [R]->The 2 wt % MWNT concentration enhanced flexural strength by 12.8% (p=0.003) and produced a 13.1% enhancement in yield stress (p=0.002) . [R]->Bending modulus increased slightly with the smaller (<5 wt % MWNT) concentrations, but increased 24.1% (p<0.001) in response to the 10 wt % loading . [R]->While the 2 wt % loading produced slightly improved quasi-static test results, it was associated with clearly superior fatigue performance (3.3x increase in the Weibull mean fatigue life) . [R]->Weibull minimum fatigue life (No), Weibull modulus (alpha), and characteristic fatigue life (beta) for bone cement augmented with carbonnanotubes were enhanced versus that observed in the control group . [D]->These data unambiguously showed that the bone cement-MWNT polymer system has an enhanced fatigue life compared to "control" bone cement (no added nanotubes) . [D]->It is concluded that specific multiwall carbonnanotube loadings can favorably improve the mechanical performance of bone cement .
