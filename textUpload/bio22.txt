[B]->The cornea is a complex tissue composed of different cell types, including corneal epithelial cells and keratocytes . [B]->Each of these cell types are directly exposed to rich nanoscale topography from the basement membrane or surrounding extracellular matrix . [B]->Nanoscale topography has been shown to influence cell behaviors, including orientation, alignment, differentiation, migration, and proliferation . [P]->We investigated whether proliferation of SV40-transformed human corneal epithelial cells (SV40-HCECs), primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), and primary corneal fibroblasts is influenced by the scale of topographic features of the substratum . [M]->Using basement membrane feature sizes as our guide and the known dimensions of collagen fibrils of the corneal stroma (20-60 nm), we fabricated polyurethane molded substrates, which contain anisotropic feature sizes ranging from 200-2000 nm on pitches ranging from 400 to 4000 nm (pitch = ridge width + groove width) . [R]->The planar regions separating each of the six patterned regions served as control surfaces . [R]->Primary corneal and SV40-HCEC proliferation decreased in direct response to decreasing nanoscale topographies down to 200 nm . [R]->In contrast to corneal epithelial cells, corneal fibroblasts did not exhibit significantly different response to any of the topographies when compared with planar controls at 5 days . [R]->However, decreased proliferation was observed on the smallest feature sizes after 14 days in culture . [D]->Results from these experiments are relevant in understanding the potential mechanisms involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation of cells within the cornea .
