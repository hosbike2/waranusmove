[P]->We have developed and tested two electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for users to control a cursor on a computerdisplay . [M]->Our system uses an adaptive algorithm, based on kernel partial least squares classification (KPLS), to associate patterns in multichannelEEG frequency spectra with cursor controls . [M]->Our first BCI, Target Practice, is a system for one-dimensional device control, in which participants use biofeedback to learn voluntary control of their EEG spectra . [M]->Target Practice uses a KPLS classifier to map power spectra of 62-electrode EEG signals to rightward or leftward position of a moving cursor on a computer display . [M]->Three subjects learned to control motion of a cursor on a video display in multiple blocks of 60 trials over periods of up to six weeks . [M]->The best subject's average skill in correct selection of the cursor direction grew from 58% to 88% after 13 training sessions . [M]->Target Practice also implements online control of two artifact sources: 1) removal of ocular artifact by linear subtraction of wavelet-smoothed vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (EOG) signals, 2) control of muscle artifact by inhibition of BCI training during periods of relatively high power in the 40-64 Hz band . [M]->The second BCI, Think Pointer, is a system for two-dimensional cursor control . [M]->Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) are triggered by four flickering checkerboard stimuli located in narrow strips at each edge of the display . [M]->The user attends to one of the four beacons to initiate motion in the desired direction . [M]->The SSVEP signals are recorded from 12 electrodes located over the occipital region . [M]->A KPLS classifier is individually calibrated to map multichannel frequency bands of the SSVEP signals to right-left or up-down motion of a cursor on a computer display . [M]->The display stops moving when the user attends to a central fixation point . [M]->As for Target Practice, Think Pointer also implements wavelet-based online removal of ocular artifact; however, in Think Pointer muscle artifact is controlled via adaptive normalization of the SSVEP . [M]->Training of the classifier requires about 3 min. [M]->We have tested our system in real-time operation in three human subjects . [R]->Across subjects and sessions, control accuracy ranged from 80% to 100% correct with lags of 1-5 s for movement initiation and turning . [R]->We have also developed a realistic demonstration of our system for control of a moving map display .
