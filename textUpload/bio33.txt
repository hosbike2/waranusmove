[P]->The aim of our work was to quantify the influence of white matter anisotropic conductivity information on electroencephalography (EEG) sourcereconstruction . [M]->We performed this quantification in a rabbit head using both simulations and source localization based on invasive measurements . [M]->In vivo anisotropic (tensorial) conductivity information was obtained from magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and included into a high-resolution finite-element model . [R]->When neglecting anisotropy in the simulations, we found a shift in source location of up to 1.3 mm with a mean value of 0.3 mm . [R]->The averaged orientational deviation was 10 degree and the mean magnitude error of the dipole was 29% . [R]->Source localization of the first cortical components after median and tibial nerve stimulation resulted in anatomically verified dipole positions with no significant anisotropy effect . [R]->Our results indicate that the expected average source localization error due to anisotropic white matter conductivity is within the principal accuracy limits of current inverse procedures . [R]->However, larger localization errors might occur in certain cases . [R]->In contrast, dipole orientation and dipole strength are influenced significantly by the anisotropy . [D]->We conclude that the inclusion of tissue anisotropy information improves source estimation procedures .
