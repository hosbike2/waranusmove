[B]->A system for objective vessel compression assessment for deep venous thrombosis characterization using ultrasound image data and a sensorized ultrasound probe is presented . [B]->Two new objective measures calculated from applied force and transverse vessel area are also presented and used to describe vessel compressibility . [B]->A modified star-Kalman algorithm is used for feature detection in acquired ultrasound images, and objectivemeasures of vessel compressibility are calculated from the detected features and acquired force and location data from the sensorized probe . [B]->A three-dimensional shape model of the examined vessel that includes compressibility measures mapped as colors to its surface is presented on the user interface, as well as a virtual representation of the image plane . [M]->The compressibility measures were validated using expert segmentation of healthy and diseased vessels and compared using paired t-tests, which showed a significant difference between healthy and diseased cases for bothmeasures . [R]->100% sensitivity and specificity were obtained for both measures . [R]->The system was implemented in real-time (16 Hz) and evaluated using a tissue phantom and on healthy human subjects . [R]->Sensitivity was 100% and 60%, while specificity was 97% for both measures when implemented . [D]->The initial results for the system and its components are promising .
