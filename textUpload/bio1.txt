[B]-> Phase unwrapping is an important problem in many magnetic resonance imaging applications, such as field mapping and flow imaging . [B]->The challenge in two-dimensional phase unwrapping lies in distinguishing jumps due to phase wrapping from those due to noise and/or abrupt variations in the actual function . [M]->This paper addresses this problem  using a Markov random field to model the true phase function, whose parameters are determined by maximizing the a posteriori probability . [P]->To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization procedure, an efficient algorithm is also proposed for parameter estimation using a series of dynamic programming connected by the iterated conditional modes . [B]->The proposed method has been tested with both simulated and experimental data . [R]->yielding better results than some of the state-of-the-art method (e.g, the popular least-squares method) in handling noisy phase images with rapid phase variations .
