[B]->It is commonly accepted that locomotor-related neuronal circuitry resides in the lumbosacral spinal cord . [B]->Pharmacological agents, epidural electrical stimulation, and sensory stimulation can be used to activate these instrinsic networks in in vitro neonatal rat and in vivo cat preparations . [P]->In this study, we investigated the use of low-level tonic intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) as a means of activating spinal locomotor networks in adult cats with complete spinal transections . [M]->Trains of low-amplitude electrical pulses were delivered to the spinal cord via groups of fine microwires implanted in the ventral horns of the lumbosacral enlargement . [R]->In contrast to published reports, tonic ISMS applied through microwires in the caudal regions of thelumbosacral enlargement (L7-S1) was more effective in eliciting alternating movements in the hindlimbs than stimulation in the rostral regions . [R]->Possible mechanisms of action of tonic ISMS include depolarization of locally oscillating networks in the lumbosacral cord, backfiring of primary afferents, or activation of propriospinal neurons .
