[B]->Tissue engineering (TE) techniques to enhance nerve regeneration following nerve damage have had limited success in matching the performance of autografts across short nerve gaps (< 10 mm) . [B]->For regeneration over longer nerve gaps, TE techniques have been less successful than autografts . [B]->Most engineered scaffolds do not present directional cues to the regenerating nerves . [P]->In our efforts to design a TE scaffold to replace the autograft, we hypothesize that anisotropic hydrogel scaffolds with gradients of a growth-promoting glycoprotein, laminin-1 (LN-1), may promote directional neurite extension and enhance regeneration . [R]->In this study we report the engineering of three-dimensional (3D) agarose scaffolds with photoimmobilized gradients of LN-1 of differing slopes . [R]->Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from chicken embryos were cultured in the agarose scaffolds and their neurite extension rate was determined . [R]->DRG neurite extension rates were significantly higher in the anisotropic scaffolds, with a maximal growth rate in an anisotropic scaffold twice that of the maximal growth rate in isotropic scaffolds of LN-1 . [D]->We suggest that these anisotropic scaffolds, presenting an optimal gradient of LN-1, may significantly impact nerve regeneration . [D]->Such anisotropic scaffolds may represent a new generation of tissue engineered materials with built-in directional cues for guided tissue or nerve regeneration .
