[P]->This article addresses the growing need for comprehensive tools to investigate the hemodynamics of ventricular assist devices (VADs) in general andsac-type VADs in particular . [B]->Numerical simulations can be very helpful in these efforts . [B]->However, full simulation of flow inside sac-type VADs poses several key problems, among them simulation of the mechanical heart valves and calculation of the motion of flexible walls . [M]->We present a simplified three-dimensional (3D) numerical model of a sac-VAD chamber . [M]->The walls in the simplified model are defined to move according to experimental measurements, and the valves are modeled in fully open or fully closed positions . [M]->The model is validated by comparison to a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction numerical simulation and to experimental measurements using continuous digital particle image velocimetry . [R]->Our results demonstrate that the flexible wall motion is sensitive to changes in pressure distribution inside the chamber . [R]->However, small variations in wall motion do not significantly affect the global features of flow inside the chamber . [D]->Therefore, the simplified model can be used to predict the 3D time-dependent flow field in the VAD .
