[B]->A novel mechatronic body weight support (BWS) system has been developed to provide precise body weight unloading for patients with neurological or other impairments during treadmill training . [M]->The system is composed of a passive elastic spring element to take over the main unloading force and an active closed-loop controlled electric drive to generate the exact desired force . [M]->Both force generating units, the passive spring and the active electric drive, act on the patient via a polyester rope connected to a harness worn by the patient . [M]->The length of the rope can be adjusted with an electric winch to adapt the system to different patient sizes . [M]->The system is fully computer controlled . [M]->At unloading loads of up to 60 kg and walking speeds of up to 3.2 km/h, the mean unloading error and the maximum unloading error of the presented BWS system was less than 1 and 3 kg, respectively . [M]->The performance was compared with those of two purely passive BWS systems currently being used by most other rehabilitation groups . [M]->This comprised counterweight systems and static BWS systems with fixed rope lengths . [R]->Counterweight systems reached mean and maximum unloading errors of up to 5.34 and 16.22 kg, respectively. [R]->The values for the static BWS were 11.02 kg and 27.67 kg, respectively . [R]->Thenovel mechatronic BWS system presented in this study adjusts desired unloading changes of up to 20 kg within less than 100 ms . [R]->Thus, not only constant BWS, but also gait cycle dependent or time variant oscillations of the desired force can be realized with high accuracy . [R]->Precise and constant unloading force is believed to be an important prerequisite for BWS gait therapy, where it is important to generate physiologically correct segmental dynamics and ground reaction forces . [D]->Thus, the novel BWS system presented in this paper is an important contribution to maximize the therapeutic outcome of human gait rehabilitation .
