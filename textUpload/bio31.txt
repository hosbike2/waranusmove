[B]->An integrated system is proposed for real-time imaging of tissue deformation in response to externally applied mechanical compression . [P]->The purpose of the system is to noninvasively detect tissue lesions based on their stiffness . [M]->The method includes applying external compression to the examined subject and acquiring magnetic resonance strain-encoded images using a real-time pulse sequence . [R]->In the proposed system, only a singlecompression is necessary to obtain a two-dimensional map of tissue deformation in a slice, eliminating the need for a complicated compressing device . [D]->The system was built and validated using phantom experiments .
