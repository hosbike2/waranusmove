[M]->This work assessed the influence of treadmill gait training with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on the metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses in quadriplegic subjects . [M]->The gait group (GG) (n=11) performed 6 months of treadmill training with 30-50% body weight support and with the help of physiotherapists, twice a week, allotting 20 min for each session . [M]->The control group (CG) (n=10), during the 6 months of training, did not perform any activity using NMES, performing instead conventional physiotherapy . [R]->Metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses (O(2) uptake [VO(2)], CO(2) production [VCO(2)], pulmonary ventilation (V(E)), heart rate [HR], and blood pressure [BP]) were measured on inclusion and after 6 months . [R]->For the GG, differences were found in all parameters after training (P<0.05), except for HR and diastolic BP . [R]->During gait, VO(2) (L/min) increased by 36%, VCO(2) (L/min) increased by 42.97%, V(E) (L/min) increased by 30.48%, and systolic BP (mm Hg) increased by 4.8% . [R]->For the CG, only VO(2) and VCO(2) (L/min) significantly increased at rest (30.82 and 16.39%, respectively) and during knee-extension exercise (26.29 and 17.37%, respectively) . [D]->Treadmill gait with NMES was, therefore, more efficient toward increasing the aerobic capacity due to yielding higher metabolic and cardiovascular stresses .
