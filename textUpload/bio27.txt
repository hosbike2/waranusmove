[B]->Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) involves a multidimensional series of tasks requiring a synthesis between visual information and the kinematics and dynamics of the surgical tools . [B]->Analysis of these sources of information is a key step in defining objective criteria for characterizing surgicalperformance . [B]->The Blue DRAGON is a new system for acquiring the kinematics and the dynamics of two endoscopic tools synchronized with the endoscopic view of the surgical scene . [B]->Modeling the process of MIS using a finite state model [Markov model (MM)] reveals the internal structure of the surgical task and is utilized as one of the key steps in objectively assessing surgical performance . [M]->The experimental protocol includes tying an intracorporeal knot in a MIS setup performed on an animal model (pig) by 30 surgeons at different levels of training including expert surgeons . [M]->An objective learning curve was defined based on measuring quantitative statistical distance (similarity) between MM of experts and MM of residents at different levels of training . [P]->The objective learning curve was similar to that of the subjective performance analysis . [R]->The MM proved to be a powerful and compact mathematical model for decomposing a complex task such as laparoscopic suturing . [D]->Systems like surgical robots or virtual reality simulators in which the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical tool are inherently measured may benefit from incorporation of the proposed methodology .
