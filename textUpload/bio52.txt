[B]->In order to use recorded neural activities from the brain as control signals for neuroprosthesis devices, it is important to maintain a stable interface between chronically implanted microelectrodes and neural tissue . [B]->Our previous paper introduced a method to quantify the stability of the recordingmicroelectrodes . [M]->In this paper, the method is refined 1) by incorporating stereotypical behavioral patterns into the spike sorting program and 2) by using a classifier based on Bayes theorem for assigning the recorded action potentials to the underlying neural generators . [R]->An improved method for calculating stability index is proposed . [R]->The results for the stability of microelectrode arrays that differ in structure are presented .
