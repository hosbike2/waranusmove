[B]->Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia . [B]->Structural cardiac defects such as fibrosis and gap junction remodeling lead to a reduced cellular electrical coupling and are known to promote atrial fibrillation . [B]->It has been observed that the expression of the hyperpolarization-activatedcurrent If is increased under pathological conditions . [B]->Recent experimental data indicate a possible contribution of If to arrhythmogenesis . [M]->In this paper, the role of If in action potential propagation in normal and in pathological tissue is investigated by means of computer simulations . [M]->The effect of diffuse fibrosis and gap junction remodeling is simulated by reducing cellular coupling nonuniformly . [R]->As expected, the conduction velocity decreases when cellular coupling is reduced . [R]->In the presence of If the conduction velocity increases both in normal and in pathological tissue . [R]->In our simulations, ectopic activity is present in regions with high expression of If and is facilitated by cellular uncoupling . [D]->We conclude that an increased If may facilitate propagation of the action potential . [D]->Hence, If may prevent conduction slowing and block . [D]->Overexpression of If may lead to ectopic activity, especially when cellular coupling is reduced under pathological conditions .
