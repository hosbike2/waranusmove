[B]->Recent neuroprosthetic work has focused on the motor cortex as a source of voluntary control signals . [B]->However, the motor cortex can be damaged in upper motor neuron degenerative diseases such as primary lateral sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . [B]->The possibility exists that prefrontal areas may also be used in neuroprosthetic devices . [P]->Here, we report the use of the cingulate cortex in a neuroprosthetic model . [R]->Seven rats were able to significantly modulate spiking activity in the cingulate cortex in order to receive reward . [D]->Furthermore, experiments with single neurons provide evidence that the cingulate cortex neuronal modulation is highly flexible and thus useful for a neuroprosthetic device .
